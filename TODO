Important for Thunar 1.2
========================

 - The layouting code for ThunarLocationButtons is still buggy. Problem shows
   with paths that include a very long directory; you cannot scroll to the
   last path component then.

 - A design for the ThunarDesktopView module must be developed and later
   be implemented.

 - We need a suite of unit tests and probably high-level tests, that enable
   us to test parts of the file manager automatically and isolate bugs
   early.

 - Setup gtk-doc to present developers with the internal API of Thunar
   to ease development of core modules (and later plugins).

 - Write good user documentation. Must be both precise and complete.

 - We need some easy way to manage diagrams and related developer
   information, which also includes results from discussions on
   thunar-dev.

 - The HACKING file must be updated with strict rules about how
   development of Thunar core modules is to be done, and what
   material each developer in addition to the source code.
