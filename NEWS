1.1.0
=====
- Replace ThunarVFS with GIO. There will be a separate maintenance
  release of ThunarVFS soon after this release. All functionality
  previously based on ThunarVFS is now implemented on top of GIO
  and GVfs. This means that remote filesystems can be accessed via
  SFTP, FTP, SMB etc. For this as well as the trash feature GVfs
  is required. Thunar does not depend on it because GVfs is a set
  of GIO extensions and there is no guarantee for those to be
  available at runtime if they are installed at buildtime. This is left
  for distributions to set up properly.
- Thumbnails are now generated using the thumbnail management D-Bus
  specification. One implementation of this specification is Tumbler
  which is released independently.
- Bump the API version of Thunarx to 2 because symbols related to
  ThunarVFS were removed and replaced by new symbols dealing with GIO.
  This requires all existing plugins to be updated and linked against
  thunarx-2 instead of thunarx-1.
- Show "Network" item in the side pane and the "Go" menu if the
  network:// URI scheme is supported by GIO (via an extension). Make
  the "Trash" item optional too.
- Use a single shared progress dialog for file operations instead of
  individual dialogs for each operation. The visual information in this
  shared dialog still has to be improved (work on this has been started
  in an experimental branch).
- Use g_utf8_strlen to calculate the side pane width (bugs #3965, #5390)
- Add startup ID parameter to the BulkRename and LaunchFiles D-Bus methods
  in order to support startup notification over D-Bus.
- Avoid requesting drag data if the drag target is GDK_NONE (bug #5771).
- Add startup notification support to the custom actions plugin.
- Use install-exec-hook for installing the thunar symlink (bug #5835).
- Use silent build rules if available.
- Use libxfce4ui instead of libxfcegui4.
- Depend on xfce4-dev-tools >= 4.7.2 to get rid of custom configure code.
- Depend on exo-1 >= 0.5.1.
- Updated translations: German, French, Chinese, Portuguese, Czech, Slovak,
  Latvian, Basque, Danish, Asturian, Japanese, Galician, Spanish, Greek,
  Turkish, Russian, Swedish, Catalan, Albanian, Kazakh.

0.5.0rc1
========
- Add a "Trash" menu entry to the "Go" menu (#2486).
- Add a drop-down menu to the toolbar-style location bar to enable quick
  access to the shortcuts even if the classic file manager look'n'feel is
  being used (#2024).
- Add support for HAL on FreeBSD. Make HAL the preferred volume manager on
  FreeBSD.
- Adjust the preferences dialog to match the look of the other Xfce preferences
  dialogs (#2379).
- Allow to change the icon of .desktop files (#2150).
- Allow Thunar extensions to add menu items to the Drag'n'Drop context menu.
  This is for example used by the thunar-archive-plugin to add an "Extract
  Here" action, which extracts a dragged archive file at the drop location.
- Display the real mime type as tooltip for the "Kind" label in the properties
  dialog (#2369).
- Keep the modification time when copying files (#2244).
- Make sure emblems don't get too large with SVG icon themes (#2466).
- Make sure Thunar is restarted prior to xfdesktop, so the trash support in
  xfdesktop works as expected even if D-Bus autoactivation is not setup
  properly.
- Place automake options into configure.in.in instead of Makefile.am and add
  the tar-ustar option to fix building distributions on system where tar
  defaults to the deprecated V7 format (#2304).
- Place cursor on the first selected file after a new file or folder was
  created (#2368).
- Place focus on the main view after changing the current directory (#2367).
- Properly clean up the path bar when a folder that is currently displayed
  on the path bar is deleted.
- Properly validate the Name of .desktop files (#2227).
- Update the icon mime icon lookup to try icon names from Icon Naming Spec
  first, and fallback to legacy GNOME icon names.
- Use default dbus connection timeout (#2243).
- Use exo-open for the default "Open Terminal Here" action (#2256).
- Use the thumbnail database to load SVG icons from the icon theme, because
  loading SVG is quite slow and takes a lot more memory than loading and
  scaling PNG icons from the thumbnail database.
- Fix usage of deprecated HAL policy functions (#2475).
- Fix crash with newer GtkTreeView's if the "row-has-child-toggled" signal is
  emitted even if the child state of a node did not change (#2372).
- Fix several race conditions that were introduced over time and prevented the
  "new-files" job handling from working properly with Gamin and automatic
  folder reload (#2199).
- Fix invalid calculation of free space on OpenBSD/amd64 (#2383).
- Fix crash due to invalid handling of file names with printf(3)-style format
  arguments (#2468).
- Fix crash on systems with small per-thread stacks (#2269).

0.4.0rc1
========
- An implementation of the XDG Trash Specification was imported and is now
  used by both Thunar and xfdesktop to display and manage trashed files.
  The implementation is currently limited to the home trash, but that will
  be extended to support foreign trash cans soon.
- Add a trash panel applet for the Xfce panel, that displays the current
  state of the trash, allows to open and empty the trash, and supports
  drops of files to the trash.
- Add "No to all" response to the transfer progress dialog, which allows to
  skip all further overwrite dialogs (Bug #1666).
- Add ISO Speed Ratings to the Image page of the properties dialog.
- Add rubberband selection support to the detailed list view when build with
  GTK+ 2.9.0 and above (Bug #1996).
- Add menus to the "Back" and "Forward" buttons in the toolbar (Bug #1782).
- Update the path bar with the latest changes to GtkFileChooser (Bug #2060).
- The dependency of the thunar-vfs library on GConf is gone. Instead the
  available thumbnailers are now determined by an external tool and added to
  a cache file, which will be mapped by all processes using the thunar-vfs
  library (Bug #2131).
- Add a new thumbnailer for TrueType fonts using the FreeType 2.x library.
- Add a warning text to the window when running as super user (Bug #2218).
- Add desktop shortcut to the shortcuts pane and use a special icon for the
  desktop folder (Bug #2235).
- Use the new icon chooser dialog, available with exo 0.3.1.10rc1, to pick
  icons for custom actions.
- Fix invalid display of the file's group in the properties dialog (Bug #1838).
- Fix the location entry completion crashing with certain GTK+ versions (Bug
  #1891).
- Fix list model related crashes with GTK+ 2.10 (Gnome Bug #349128).
- Use CRLF for text/uri-list as specified by RFC 2483 (Bug #2166).
- Fix invalid substitution of %d in custom commands (Bug #2214).
- Fix not working Ctrl+A in the location entry (Bug #2036).
- Fix the progress bar text being truncated (Bug #2003).
- Fix missing mkdtemp on Solaris (Bug #2070).
- Fix compilation with compilers other than gcc (Bug #1852).
- Fix compilation on NetBSD 2.99 and above.
- Fix compilation on OpenBSD.
- Add manual page for Thunar (Bug #1650).
- Unmount volumes prior to ejecting them (Bug #2236).
- Do not use different icons to represent the home folder.
- Use "<folder> - File Manager" for the title of Thunar windows to make it
  easier to identify file manager windows in the taskbar.
- The thunar-vfs reference manual was updated to reflect the latest changes.
- Case sensitive sorting is now disabled by default (Bug #2064).
- Use a localized human readable format for the file dates (Bug #2057).
- Use the new GSlice allocator where possible to reduce memory overhead.
- Avoid the usage of GMemChunk, because in GLib 2.10 and above that is not
  only inefficient, but also continously leaks memory.

==========
- The default operation when dropping files into a folder is now to move the
  files if both the source files and the target folder is on the same file
  system and the source files are owned by the user.
- The custom actions are now run using the shell.
- Added the "Send To" menu, which allows users to easily send files to other
  applications from within the file manager. Default targets are "Desktop
  (Create Link)", "Mail Recipient" and "Side Pane (Create Shortcut)". Additio-
  nal targets can be dynamically added via .desktop files.
- Support for session management was added.
- The "Open With" dialog now allows users to remove launchers that were
